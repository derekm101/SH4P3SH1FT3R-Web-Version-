# SH4P3SH1FT3R-Web-Version-
The first initial program I made of my game concept. This is the web version.
Controls are the same: "WASD" or Arrow Keys to move, "R" for special move, "F" to change Shapes.
Dev Note: I never got around to finishing the web version of this game, I switched to python instead. Enemies don't work, you don't lose health, nor is there a round and score system.
